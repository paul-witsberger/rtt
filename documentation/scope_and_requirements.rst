**Project Name**: Real-Time Trajectories (RTT)

**Stakeholders**:
- Developer (me). The project needs to be simple enough that I can reasonably 
	learn and use the appropriate tools, and that I can complete it within an
	acceptable timeframe.
- Owner (me). The project should demonstrate my coding abilities in a positive
	manner. The completed project should be something that I can be proud of,
	and that a recruiter would look favorably upon.
- Users (me, recruiters, interested 3rd parties). The app should simple to
	install, straightforward to use, and should not consume an 
	inappropriately high amount of computing resources (unless given an option
	to do so).
- Recruiters. The project should be well organized and documented, with a 
	sufficient level of complexity to demonstrate my coding abilities. 

**Project Objectives**:
- Develop an application to compute and display optimal spacecraft trajectories.
- Allow users to interactively select starting and ending points around a planet.
- Allow users to change simulation settings.

**Deliverables**:
- Main application window displaying the planet.
- User interface for selecting points and adjusting settings.
- Real-time trajectory calculation and display.
- Either a) an executable that users can run, or b) a web app.

**Inclusions**:
- Trajectory optimization algorithm.
- User settings panel for adjusting flight parameters.

**Exclusions**:
- Detailed 3D rendering of the planet.
- Advanced physics simulations beyond basic trajectory calculations.

**Timeline**:
- Project kickoff: August 1, 2024
- Initial prototype: September 15, 2024
- Final release: December 1, 2024

**Budget**:
- Total estimated cost: $200

**Constraints**:
- Limited to using C++ for the majority of the codebase.
- Must be completed within 4 months.

**Assumptions**:
- Users have basic knowledge of spacecraft navigation.
- Adequate computational resources are available for real-time calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Trajectories solve and plot in less than half a second after the boundary points
	are set.
- Users can choose set time-of-flight, thrust, spacecraft mass, pro- or retro-
	grade, planet mass, and planet diameter.
